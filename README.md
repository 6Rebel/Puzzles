## Hard Interview Puzzles
1. There is a village of wizards and a village of dwarves. Once a year, the wizards go over to the village of dwarves and line all the dwarves up in increasing height order, such that each dwarf can only see the dwarves smaller than himself. The wizards have an infinite supply of white and black hats. They place either a white or black hat on the head of each dwarf. Then, starting with the tallest dwarf (in the back of the line), they ask each what color hat he is wearing. If the dwarf answers incorrectly, the wizards kill him (the other dwarves can hear his answer, but can't tell if he was killed or not). What strategy can the dwarves use to minimize the number of dwarves that are killed? What is the most number of dwarves that will be killed using this optimal strategy? ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Wizards+and+Dwarves+solution))
2. Consider a two-player game played on a circular table of unspecified diameter. Each player has an infinite supply of quarters, and take turns placing a quarter on the table such that it is completely on the table and does not overlap with any other quarters already played. A player wins if he makes the last legal move. Which player (if any) has a strategy that will guarantee a win, and what is that strategy?

15. Alice and Bob are on separate islands. Bob is sick, and Alice has the medicine. Eve has a boat and a chest that can be locked. She is willing to transport objects between Alice and Bob, but only in the chest, and if the chest is unlocked, she will steal whatever is inside.

20. You have two ropes and a box of matches. Each rope takes exactly one hour to burn, but they may not necessarily burn evenly -- i.e., the first half might burn in the first 10 minutes and the second in the remaining 50). How can you measure out 45 minutes by just using these two ropes? ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Two+ropes+solution))
21. Consider three identical airplanes starting at the same airport. Each plane has a fuel tank that holds just enough fuel to allow the plane to travel half the distance around the world. These airplanes possess the special ability to transfer fuel between their tanks in mid-flight. Devise a scheme that will allow one airplane to travel all the way around the world, landing only at the original airport. ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Three+airplanes+solution))
22. You are at the bottom of the elevator shaft of a 100 story building. You see 21 wires labelled 1...21. The wires go up to the 100th floor where the ends are labelled A...U, but you don't know how they correspond to the ends at the bottom. You have a battery, a light bulb, and many small wires. How can you determine the pairing between the numbers and letters by only making one trip to the 100th floor and back down? ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Elevator+and+wires+solution))
23. A woman starts paddling upstream in a canoe, and after one mile, encounters a log floating with the current. She continues to paddle upstream for onehour, then turns around and paddles downstream, until she returns to the dock where she started. If the woman and the log reach the dock at exactly the same time, how fast was the current flowing? Assume all speeds are constant. ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Canoe+solution))
24. Consider a centrifuge with 12 slots for test tubes. When you use a centrifuge, the tubes must be placed in the slots so that they are radially balanced (we can assume all tubes have the same mass). For example, for 3 tubes, you would place them in slots 4, 8 and 12. How can you place exactly 5 tubes in the centrifuge so that they are radially balanced? ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Centrifuge+solution))
25. You are on a strict medical regimen that requires you to take two types of pills each day. You must take exactly one A pill and exactly one B pill at the same time. The pills are very expensive, and you don't want to waste any. So you open the bottle of A pills, and tap one out into your hand. Then you open the bottle of B pills and do the same thing -- but you make a mistake, and two B pills come out into your hand with the A pill. But the pills are all exactly identical. There is no way to tell A pills apart from B pills. How can you satisfy your regimen and take exactly one of each pill at the same time, without wasting any pills? ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Pills+solution))
26. Write an algorithm to find a given element in an n by n matrix where the rows and columns are monotonically increasing. ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Monotonic+matrix+solution))
27. General Alice and General Bob, commanders of the allied armies A and B, respectively, are camped in the mountains on either side of a valley. Alice and Bob would like to attack enemy army C, camped in the valley below. Army A by itself is unable to defeat army C, as is army B, but a coordinated attack by A and B at the same time will secure a victory for Alice and Bob. However, the only way Alice and Bob can communicate is by sending messengers through the valley, who may or may not get captured en route by the enemy army C. Is there an algorithm by which Alice and Bob can coordinate an attack on army C so as to secure their victory? ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Two+armies+solution))
28. Consider a circular race track with n gas stations spaced along it, each containing a fixed amount of gas. You are given an array containing the distances between consecutive gas stations and an array containing the amount of gas at each. Suppose the total amount of gas at all the gas stations is the same as the number of miles around the race track. Your car gets one mile to the gallon, but its gas tank has an unlimited capacity. Where do you start your car along the race track to guarantee that you get all the way around without running out of gas? Do this in O(n) time. ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Circular+race+track+solution))
29. Given an array of n integers, find all Pythagorean triples in the array, that is, three elements such that a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Do this in O(n^2) time. ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Pythagorean+triples+solution))
30. You are on a spaceship that has a computer with n processors. Suddenly, the spaceship gets hit with an alien laser beam, and some of the processors are damaged. However, you know that more than half of the processors are still good. You can ask one processor whether it thinks another processor is good or bad. A good processor will always tell the truth, but a bad one will always lie. A 'step' consists of asking one processor if it thinks another processor is good or bad. Find one good processor, only using n-2 steps. ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Good+and+bad+processors+solution))
31. Given an array of n integers, where one element appears more than n/2 times, find that element in linear time and constant extra space. ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Array+mode+solution))
32. A spinning disc is painted black on one half and white on the other (i.e., the line forming the border between the black and white regions of the disc is a diameter of the disc). The disk is spinning on a turntable in an unknown direction at an unknown speed. You have special video cameras that can observe the color of a single point on the disc. How many cameras do you need to determine the direction the disc is spinning? ([Solution](http://everything2.com/title/Spinning+disc+solution))

The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. Not all people take the same time to cross the bridge. Times for each person:  1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins. What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?([Solution](http://www.mytechinterviews.com/four-people-on-a-rickety-bridge))

39. Two old friends, Jack and Bill, meet after a long time.

    Jack: Hey, how are you man?

    Bill: Not bad, got married and I have three kids now.

    Jack: That’s awesome. How old are they?

    Bill: The product of their ages is 72 and the sum of their ages is the same as your birth date.

    Jack: Cool… But I still don’t know.
